## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- TypeScript
- React Context + custom hooks
- Drag-and-drop logic via native events

### What I learned

- How to structure scalable React apps using separation of concerns and hooks.
- How to use `Context API` for centralized state management.
- How to implement some animations and modal-windows.
- How to toggle a sidebar.

### Continued development

## In the future I’d like to:

- Add animations to the drag-and-drop actions
- Add unit and integration tests (e.g. with Testing Library)
- Add user authentication and backend persistence (Firebase/Supabase)
- Make the app accessible (ARIA, keyboard drag support, etc.)

## Useful resources

- React Docs — the go-to for working with hooks and context
- TypeScript Docs
- framer-motion library
